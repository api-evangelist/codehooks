# Codehooks (codehooks)
Codehooks is a software development tool that allows developers to easily create and manage custom code snippets that can be triggered automatically during specific events in their workflow. These snippets, known as "code hooks," can perform a wide range of actions, such as updating a database, sending notifications, or running automated tests. Codehooks streamlines the development process by providing a centralized platform for storing and executing these reusable code snippets, thereby saving developers time and effort. With its user-friendly interface and robust functionality, Codehooks empowers developers to enhance their productivity and efficiency when building and deploying software applications.
