  Codehooks is a software development tool that allows developers to easily
  create and manage custom code snippets that can be triggered automatically
  during specific events in their workflow. These snippets, known as "code
  hooks," can perform a wide range of actions, such as updating a database,
  sending notifications, or running automated tests. Codehooks streamlines the
  development process by providing a centralized platform for storing and
  executing these reusable code snippets, thereby saving developers time and
  effort. With its user-friendly interface and robust functionality, Codehooks
  empowers developers to enhance their productivity and efficiency when building
  and deploying software applications.
